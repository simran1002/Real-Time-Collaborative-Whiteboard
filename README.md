Real-time collaboration whiteboards are digital platforms that allow multiple users to work together on a shared virtual canvas, just like a physical whiteboard, but with the added advantage of real-time interaction over the internet. These tools are commonly used in various professional and educational settings for brainstorming, presentations, design work, and team collaboration.
